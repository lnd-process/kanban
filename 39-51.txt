.
econd step of the five-step roadmap is “Prioritize the work.”

Prioritizing is about classifying the tasks given their level of importance.

This step is essential because, before adopting Kanban, many teams have members

multitasking and treating the tasks as if they all have the same urgency.

And, as we previously discussed, this behavior hurts the team’s productivity.

One example of how to prioritize tasks is to classify them as “Must Have,” “Should

Have,” “Could Have,” or “Won’t Have.”

This classification scheme is known as MoSCow prioritization

and is widely used by agile teams.

The priority of the tasks must be reflected on the Kanban Board’s leftmost

column, having the ones with higher priority on the top of the column.

At this point, you will have identified and prioritized the work,

being in good shape for conducting

the roadmap’s third step, which we will discuss in the following lecture!

The third step is to map the workflow on your board, which in practice

means defining your board's columns.

The critical thing to consider here is that, at this stage,

we don't create a new workflow.

Instead, we start with what we currently have.

In other words, at this stage, we focus on setting up the board

for the team's current workflow.

In the following lecture, we will discuss the roadmapâ€™s next step.

43.
Now that we have the workflow mapped, on the fourth step, we define Work In

Progress limits, of course, because we do not want the team's flow to have queues.

Setting up the WIP limits is an empirical process; in other words, the team

learns the ideal limits by observing the workflow and making adjustments.

However, we can define the initial limits by considering the number

of people available for each column and the work's complexity.

In the following lecture, we will wrap up this section by discussing

the roadmap's fifth and last step.

44. 
Finally, we are at the last step of adopting Kanban: “Enter Kaizen Cycle.”

Here is where Kanban’s mindset is really put into action.

Kaizen is a Japanese word that means "improvement".

And, when I say "improvement", we automatically think about "change".

But, changing what?

Changing the process.

Kanban is a mechanism to guide changes in the team’s processes by focusing

on reducing waste, such as queues, and making the process more efficient,

in other words, reducing the team's cycle time and lead

time and increasing throughput.

With Kanban, and this is also true with any lean or agile approach, there is

no such thing as a universal cookbook with all the details about the ideal

configuration of Kanban for your team.

Thus, it is up to the team members to collaborate and use their

knowledge and intelligence to empirically configure Kanban’s

aspects, such as the Work-In-Progress limits, to suit their needs.

They do that by following a build-measure-learn loop, where they

start with ideas, build their workflow and define the team's policies and metrics.

Then, they measure their workflow, learn by analyzing the collected data,

come up with new ideas, and so on.

For this purpose, it is crucial to define feedback events, which are planned

timeslots for the team to come together and inspect their progress by, for

example, analyzing the Continuous Flow Diagram and defining process improvements.

For example, some teams hold such meetings weekly, and others

have them every other week.

It is up to the team to decide the frequency that suits them best.

Another example of a feedback cycle is holding short daily meetings

to allow the team to synchronize tasks and analyze their workflow.

For example, they could discuss if the flow is going slower than

expected or if there are items that are taking too long to complete?

If it is the case, what can they do to get faster and complete these tasks?

In summary, to kick off your Kanban initiative, there is no mystery;

there is no need to hire, there is no need to create new positions,

and there is no need to define new processes or update existing ones.

You just need to identify the work, prioritize it, map the existing workflow,

limit Work In Progress, and start inspecting your process and adapting.

It is an evolutionary process, where the team defines their workflow, policies, and

metrics continuously as they learn more.

But, we are not done yet.

In the next section, let's discuss common mistakes people make when adopting Kanban

to avoid having you fall into these traps.

See you there!

45.
In this section, we will quickly cover common mistakes when adopting Kanban.

The first classic mistake of Kanban beginners is not defining

the Work In Progress limits.

Many people think this is a Kanban Board, but it is not!

Why?

Because it is missing the Work In Progress limits.

Are you using Work In Progress limits?

If the answer is no, you are not using a Kanban Board and,

of course, not adopting Kanban.

It is as simple as this.

Many beginners don’t define Work In Progress limits because they don’t know

how to come up with the ideal limits.

However, as we have discussed in this course, these limits are Kanban’s primary

weapon to solve the queue problem.

Thus, you should define initial Work In Progress limits following

the tips provided in this course and, later, enter the Kaizen

Cycle and adjust them as needed.

We are done talking about the first classical mistake when adopting Kanban.

Let’s discuss one more in the following lecture.

See you there!

46.
The first classic mistake is not defining Work In Progress limits.

The second one is closely related: not respecting Work In Progress limits.

Some beginners define the limits and feel like everything is fine.

In this example, notice that the Work In Progress is already at

the limit for this column meaning that no tasks could be pulled.

Then, a new task is created.

A task that is not urgent, according to the team’s policies.

And, what do they do?

They start working on it, even though they're breaking the limits!

because “it is an exception” and “we are only doing it once.”

But, guess what happens?

This “only once” situation will start to happen over and over again.

And as a consequence, Kanban’s potential benefits will be destroyed.

If you want to implement a culture of continuous flow, respect the WIP limit.

Do the possible and the impossible to follow such limits.

You should only ignore these limits if the task is urgent according to the team’s

policies, as we discussed in this course.

And, if this is the case, make sure that the urgent task is easily distinguished

on the board by using different colors and a dedicated swimlane.

Let’s discuss one more mistake in the following lecture!

See you there!

47.

At this point, we have discussed two common mistakes when adopting Kanban.

The third one is about working on ghost tasks.

And what is a ghost task?

It is a task that a team member is working on but is not shown on the Kanban Board!

If it's not on the board, the team can check the Work In Progress

limits and loses track of key metrics such as cycle time and lead time!

The classic example is whenever your boss asks you to work on something else, even

though you are already assigned to work on items that are on the Kanban Board.

But, you say “yes,” even though it is against the team’s policies because you

are afraid of saying “no” to your boss.

Your boss shouldn’t be doing this, but, unfortunately, in

real life, many of them do.

What to do?

Your team should talk about the issue with your boss and discuss the implications

of such behavior on the team’s efficiency and the value delivered to the client.

And, collaboratively, you should be able to, as professionals, come up

with a work agreement that will be beneficial for your organization.

We are done talking about “ghost” tasks.

Let’s discuss one more mistake in adopting Kanban in the following lecture.

See you there!

48. At this point, we have covered three common mistakes that

beginners do when adopting Kanban.

Let’s now discuss the fourth, and last, common mistake: ignoring

the Cumulative Flow Diagram.

Some beginners ignore it because it seems easier to measure performance and manage

flow by looking at the Kanban Board.

For example, we can see that we have a large queue forming on the Review column.

However, the Kanban Board is just a snapshot of the current situation.

The CFD gives you historical data, enabling the team to identify trends

by analyzing the chart and visually seeing how key metrics such as the Lead

Time, Cycle Time, Work in Progress, and Throughput has been changing.

Thus, don’t be lazy in setting up or understanding the CFP just

because you are not used to it.

The CFD is as easy to understand as a pie or bar chart, you might

just need a little bit of time to get more familiarized with it.

Given this, keep your CFD updated, and be sure to monitor it frequently.

And, this is the last common mistake in adopting Kanban that

we will discuss in this course.

49.
In this course, so far, you learned that

Kanban is a way of optimizing the flow of value by using

a process based on a visual, Work-In-Progress limited pull system.

As a result, it helps you to solve the queue problem, remove waste,

and focus on the essentials.

We learn many Kanban tools such as Kanban Board, limiting Work In Progress, metrics,

Cumulative Flow Diagram, and more.

Kanban has been adopted in many contexts.

Several agile initiatives use Kanban to improve the way they work.

Even traditional, plan-based initiatives use some of Kanban’s

aspects, such as the board, to enhance communication and workflow.

However, remember when I talked about Toyota at the begging of the course?

Kanban was created by Toyota and was part of a system known as the

Toyota Product System, which we usually refer to as “lean thinking.”

Kanban is a powerful management tool; however, it is not a

pillar of Lean thinking or the secret to Toyota’s success.

Lean thinking goes beyond management tools.

It is about having the organization committed to continuously respecting and

investing in its people and promoting a culture of continuous improvement.

The organization should create an environment that encourages people to

challenge everything and embrace change.

Lean thinking is about teamwork and challenging the status quo by

constantly analyzing what you're doing and looking for ways to improve.

Kanban is a tool for bringing Lean thinking to life.

Thus, if you want to make the most out of Kanban, your organization must follow the

two principles of Lean thinking, respect for people, and continuous improvement.

Notice that Lean thinking principles closely relate to the 4 Kanban Principles

discussed earlier in this course.

The primary outcome here is that principles come over practices or tools.

Having said this, I hope you feel ready and motivated to put Kanban into practice!

But, the course is not over yet!

In the following sections, you will learn more about how Kanban relates to

the agile mindset and tools that will improve your chances of succeeding

with your Kanban initiatives!

Let’s keep moving.

As we saw in this course, the Kanban Board is universal and can be applied

to pretty much any organization.

Setting the Kanban board aside and talking about the Kanban Method,

which is more comprehensive, I have already mentioned that it fits

well with most agile approaches.

A common case is to combine Kanban with the most used agile

approach in the world, Scrum.

The resulting combination is what many people call Scrumban.

Scrumban focuses on agility and continuous value delivery

to the client, and it fits well for various industry sectors.

Given this, this course wouldn’t be complete if it didn’t cover Scrumban.

Since it is possible that you are not familiarized with Scrum yet, before

getting into Scrumban, the following section covers Scrum fundamentals.

If you have already mastered Scrum, you can skip it.

As a quick note, if you decide to skip the Scrum section, I suggest you mark all the

lectures as done to avoid having issues with the course completion certificate.

Ready for the final push and get done with the course?

I will see you in the next lecture!

51.

Let's get started at full throttle by understanding, in

a nutshell, how Scrum works.

Scrum is very simple.

You start with a problem.

It might be, for instance, developing a new product or service.

Examples here include building new software or adding new features or

fixes to an existing one, designing a new car or building, developing an

innovative marketing strategy for your company, a new online course, and so on.

In Scrum, the team takes the problem and breaks it into smaller chunks.

For an e-commerce website, breaking the problem would be listing its

features such as sign up and login pages, having support for Content

Management System features, having payment methods, registering products,

shopping cart, product search, and so on.

The team lists everything in a to-do list called the Product Backlog.

This list is ordered so that the work on the top has a higher

priority than the work on the bottom.

Afterward, during a team event called the Sprint Planning, the team collaboratively

selects a few of the top to-do items such as "developing sign up and login pages" to

compose what is called the Sprint Backlog.

The items on the Sprint Backlog are developed and delivered in what is called

a Sprint, which is the heart of Scrum.

A Sprint is a period of at most one month.

At the end of each Sprint, a product Increment is delivered.

And what is an Increment?

For an eCommerce website, it is the website up and running , with

the new functionality, ready to go.

In other words, it is something that the customer can look at and see if it's

good or not; if it fits their needs.

If it does, great, the team is going on the right path.

If not, great too!

Now, the team has enough knowledge to adapt their to-do list and

improve their chances of delivering the best product or service.

So, the team keeps running the Sprints and refining the Product Backlog with

the acquired knowledge from inspecting Increments until the customer or

business decides that the product is good enough, or there's no more budget left.

To make this work, Scrum prescribes events and accountabilities.

Let's start with the events.

Scrum is composed of five events.

The first one is the Sprint, which is a container for the remaining ones.

Then, we have the Spring Planning, which we have already talked about, which

happens at the beginning of each Sprint.

And then, we have two events at the end of the Sprint, the Sprint

Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

The Sprint Review is about inspecting the Increment and

adapting the Product Backlog, which we have previously discussed.

The Sprint Retrospective is about the team's continuous improvement.

So, it's about inspecting the team's processes and adapting them to

deliver as efficiently as possible.

And finally, there's the Daily Scrum, a 15 minutes event that happens daily,

where the team inspects and adapts their work, giving the team complete focus

on achieving the goals of the Sprint.

Now, let's talk about the three accountabilities.

The first one is the Product Owner.

The PO is the single person accountable for managing the Product Backlog,

ensuring that everybody is aligned with the work to do and that the

most important stuff is done first.

The Product Owner's goal is to maximize the value of the product!

Then we have the Developers.

They are the ones that transform the to-do list into Increments..

And last but not least, we have a fancy one, the Scrum Master, the one

who facilitates all of this work.

Together, they form the Scrum Team!

And that's it!

You've done it.

You had a glimpse of how Scrum works in just a few minutes!

I think this might be a record.

Don't feel overwhelmed if you feel like this video was too much.

The idea here was just for you to get a big picture of how Scrum works.

We will get into the details of everything that we have

discussed here in future lectures.
