That's it!

I hope you enjoyed this incredible journey we made here by learning

Kanban, Scrum, and Scrumban.

In this course, you have understood each of their detail, practice them,

and had an unforgettable experience.

Furthermore, I hope you transform all you learned here into

opportunities for your growth.

To do so, just look at the current scenario of your company or the company

you work for and analyze which principles and practices you learned could be applied

to the company and bring improvements.

If you find opportunities, make suggestions.

Feel free to use the examples shown in this course.

There is no need to implement everything, but if the workflow at the company is

obscure, now you know how to map it and may want to suggest using a Kanban board.

Or, if you are having problems with queues in the process, offer training about

how this flow can be monitored through metrics such as lead time, cycle time,

work item age, and throughput and charts such as the Cumulative Flow Diagram.

Suggest improvements.

Make it happen.

I wish you much success.

It was an immense pleasure to be with you in this course, and continue to count

on me, both during and after the course.

I want to see your success, and I would be pleased if you could send me

a message here or on LinkedIn sharing your experience of how this course

helped you to succeed in your life.

I hope to be with you again soon!
