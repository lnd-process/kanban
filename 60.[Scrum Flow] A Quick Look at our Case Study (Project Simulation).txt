To demonstrate how Scrum works, detailing, how each event should be held, how

each artifact is constructed and sustained, we will use a case study.

And, I'm not talking about a toy example, but an actual product.

For the case study, we will simulate developing a Web app,

which we will cover in a little bit.

Still, I invite you to go further and try to follow my lead by a applying

Scrum to a project of your own, be it creating a new marketing strategy

for your company, a personal branding strategy on LinkedIn or other social

networks, constructing an online course, such as this one, or whatever problem

or opportunity you're facing right now.

The case study we will cover is perfect for understanding how Scrum

works, but your learning experience will be more valuable if you

follow my steps, understand what I'm doing, and try to apply it to

your life; right here, right now.

If you just want to follow the case study, that's totally fine too.

It will be enough for you to master how Scrum works.

If you get stuck somehow or need help, you can count on me.

Just leave a question on the courseâ€™s Q&A board.

In the following lecture, I will present an overview of the case study.

See you there.
