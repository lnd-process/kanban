We are almost getting done!

There are only two more events for you to master: Sprint

Review and Sprint Retrospective.

Now, let's talk about the Sprint Review!

As we have previously discussed, the Sprint Review is held

at the end of each Sprint.

Its goal is to inspect the Increment or any other outcome of the Sprint and, if

needed, adapt the Product Backlog or determine any other future adaptations.

Ideally, for this meeting, you will have the presence of users,

customers, and internal stakeholders.

For Konyu, this could be, for instance, the person in charge of operations or

someone responsible for customer support.

And, it would be awesome to have people representing the target customers,

such as a collector or store owner.

If they can't show up, the Product Owner represents their interests, but it is

essential for them to be there because if they inspect the Increment, they can

give the Scrum Team valuable feedback.

With the collected feedback, the Scrum Team can analyze and

update the Product Backlog.

Further, the progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

As with all the other Scrum events, the Sprint Review is also time-boxed.

For a one-month Sprint, it is time-boxed to 4 hours.

For shorter Sprints, it is usually shorter.

Now that you have an overview of the Sprint Review, letâ€™s learn more about

how to execute one in the next lecture.

See you there.
