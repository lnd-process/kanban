In my final words about the GTD, what I want to tell you is that you just

received here the Ferrari of productivity.

Getting things done is thought and applied in large companies to training

and courses, and it's considered the best methodology in the world to make us

productive people in everything we do.

I, in particular, am passionate about GTD.

It is very practical.

I really use it in my day-to-day, activities and I have really good results.

So I strongly recommend that you start practicing GTD today.

Whether as a whole, or just simplify it a little bit for starters, but try

to do it, try to put it in practice.

Experiment with all the tips that I have given you here.

Write down your appointments, put them on some lists, and

include them in your calendar.

You will see how you will become someone much more productive and trustworthy for

everyone around you and for yourself.

You will have enough organization.

You're going to be able to organize your life.

You will have the ability to promise and fulfill the responsibilities.

So now it's up to you.

I know a lot of people that had a very messy life, and they started

to use GTD and improved a lot.

I'm going to end with this final note.

As with any process, you need to experiment with it and mold it for

your lifestyle, for your character.

Each person has individual needs.

So maybe you might try to apply it on your first week, and you're not going to

have like great results, but keep trying.

Organizing your work, applying GTD is a skill that you can learn.

And I can assure you if you master yourself in doing this, you will

be a way more efficient person.
