econd step of the five-step roadmap is “Prioritize the work.”

Prioritizing is about classifying the tasks given their level of importance.

This step is essential because, before adopting Kanban, many teams have members

multitasking and treating the tasks as if they all have the same urgency.

And, as we previously discussed, this behavior hurts the team’s productivity.

One example of how to prioritize tasks is to classify them as “Must Have,” “Should

Have,” “Could Have,” or “Won’t Have.”

This classification scheme is known as MoSCow prioritization

and is widely used by agile teams.

The priority of the tasks must be reflected on the Kanban Board’s leftmost

column, having the ones with higher priority on the top of the column.

At this point, you will have identified and prioritized the work,

being in good shape for conducting

the roadmap’s third step, which we will discuss in the following lecture!
