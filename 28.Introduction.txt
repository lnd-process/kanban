nban is about continuous improvement.

To achieve it, we need to experiments by analyzing the workflow, identifying

improvement opportunities, putting them into practice, analyzing again, and so on.

To make this happen, we need to be able to diagnose the workflow, measure

it, and have high-quality indicators to know what needs to be improved.

And this is the topic of this section: how to measure your workflow!

Measuring is about collecting data, usually numbers, that indicate something.

We call the collected data "metrics".

For example, imagine a bedridden patient; how does the doctor know his state?

He uses instruments to measure the patient's vital sign, such as the

number of heartbeats per minute, body temperature, and so on.

Then, based on these metrics, the doctor concludes if the

patient is healthy and improving.

In Kanban, we do the same thing; our patient is the workflow.

We measure the workflow and collect metrics that will give us indicators

to make better-informed decisions on how to improve the workflow.

In this section, we will discuss five crucial Kanban metrics, how to collect

them, and how to present the metrics in a visual and easy-to-understand way.

See you in the following lecture, where we will cover our first

Kanban metric: the lead time!

See you there!.
