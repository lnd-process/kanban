The first classic mistake is not defining Work In Progress limits.

The second one is closely related: not respecting Work In Progress limits.

Some beginners define the limits and feel like everything is fine.

In this example, notice that the Work In Progress is already at

the limit for this column meaning that no tasks could be pulled.

Then, a new task is created.

A task that is not urgent, according to the team’s policies.

And, what do they do?

They start working on it, even though they're breaking the limits!

because “it is an exception” and “we are only doing it once.”

But, guess what happens?

This “only once” situation will start to happen over and over again.

And as a consequence, Kanban’s potential benefits will be destroyed.

If you want to implement a culture of continuous flow, respect the WIP limit.

Do the possible and the impossible to follow such limits.

You should only ignore these limits if the task is urgent according to the team’s

policies, as we discussed in this course.

And, if this is the case, make sure that the urgent task is easily distinguished

on the board by using different colors and a dedicated swimlane.

Let’s discuss one more mistake in the following lecture!

See you there!
