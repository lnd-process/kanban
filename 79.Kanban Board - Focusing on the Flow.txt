Scrumban teams use a Kanban board to manage and visualize their work.

As the name implies, the Kanban board arose from Kanban when

Scrum did not even exist.

Still, Scrum teams usually use a board like this to promote transparency and

collaboration between team members.

However, there are two details here.

First, Scrum Teams usually have a simple board with a few columns,

such as this one, since they don't manage the flow in detail.

As a consequence, we have a black box regarding the status of each

work item whenever they have started because, by looking at the board,

we can't see many details about it.

We only know that the item is in progress.

Second, their boards usually don’t have Work in Progress

limits, a Kanban practice.

For this reason, in situations like this, I say that, technically, this is

not a Kanban Board but a Scrum Board.

In contrast, a Kanban Board has Work In Progress limits and

more columns, reflecting the team’s workflow more precisely.

Scrumban teams use a Kanban Board such as this one.

However, there is still something here.

Stop the video for a few seconds and try to figure out why this

Kanban Board doesn’t reflect one used by Scrumban teams.

The problem with this board is that it is missing the “Ready”

column, which represents the Scrumban team’s iteration backlog.

Thus, compared to Scrum, Scrumban’s boards have Work in Progress limits

and, usually, more columns giving the team the necessary information

to monitor and control the flow.

Compared to Kanban, Scrumban’s boards have the “Ready” column

making the iteration backlog visible.

In the next lecture, let us discuss Work in Progress limits.

See you there!
