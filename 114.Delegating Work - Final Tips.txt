In this lecture, let's wrap up talking about delegating work.

As we have discussed in previous lectures, there are three types of delegation,

Gofer, Dump & Run, and Stewardship.

Gofer gives too many instructions on how to get the work done and might cause

people not to care about the end result.

Dump & Run gives people too much freedom.

Lacking enough support or instructions, people might get lost.

Ideally, you would go for the Stewardship Delegation.

Because it has a good balance between giving people the freedom to define how

to get work done but with enough support.

However, as discussed in previous lectures, other

types might sometimes work.

Thus, instead of choosing a type, focus on the pillars.

Whenever you're delegating work, ask yourself three questions: first, do they

know what is the result to be achieved?

Second, are they aware of the task restrictions, deadlines,

standards, reporting mechanisms, decision-making freedom...

Make sure that everything is transparent and make sure to

not transmit lack of trust.

And third, do they know how to get the work done?

If not, provide training.

And be there for them along the way.

Sounds good?

Try to adopt each aspect of delegation and observe the results.

I am sure that learning how to delegate work will make you

shine as an effective leader.
