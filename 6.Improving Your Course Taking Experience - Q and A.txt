Improving Your Course Taking Experience: Q&A
Udemy provides an excellent tool for you to ask me questions and suggest new ideas: the course Q&A board.



I answer my students daily. Thus, seize the opportunity to send a message through the Q&A board:



- You need an extra explanation about a lecture such as additional examples;

- You think there is something wrong in a lecture or quiz;

- You have an idea that you want to share;

- You have a question about something specific to a given context and related to the course;

- You think something is missing;

- Or any other reason :-)



Since I always answer questions with lots of details, the Q&A board is an excellent learning source. Plus, you can collaborate with other students.



How to use the Q&A
