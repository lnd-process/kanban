Let's start talking about the Product Goal.

The Product Goal describes a future state of the product, which can serve as a

target for the Scrum Team to plan against.

Now, the question is: what fulfills the Product Goal?

What do we need to do to get there?

And the answer is the rest of the Product Backlog.

Having a Product Goal is key for giving the Scrum Team a concrete

strategy on what it needs to build to deliver a valuable, useful product.

But, what is a product?

According to the Scrum Guide, a product is a vehicle to deliver value.

It has a clear boundary, known stakeholders, and

well-defined users or customers.

A product could be a service, a physical product, or something more abstract.

Thus, the product itself cannot be the goal.

It is just a means to achieve a higher level objective, which might be to

increase profit, acquire users, explore a new technology or marketplace,

have a specific social impact,

and so on.

Therefore, the Product Goal is the long-term objective for the Scrum

Team, and the Scrum Team might need multiple Sprints to fulfill it.

Who is accountable for it?

The Product Owner, of course.

He or she is responsible for developing and explicitly

communicating the Product Goal.

Now, for you to have a better grasp of the Product Goal, in the

next lecture, let's discuss the Product Goal from a more practical

perspective by defining one for Konyu.

See you there.
