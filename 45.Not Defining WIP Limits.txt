In this section, we will quickly cover common mistakes when adopting Kanban.

The first classic mistake of Kanban beginners is not defining

the Work In Progress limits.

Many people think this is a Kanban Board, but it is not!

Why?

Because it is missing the Work In Progress limits.

Are you using Work In Progress limits?

If the answer is no, you are not using a Kanban Board and,

of course, not adopting Kanban.

It is as simple as this.

Many beginners don’t define Work In Progress limits because they don’t know

how to come up with the ideal limits.

However, as we have discussed in this course, these limits are Kanban’s primary

weapon to solve the queue problem.

Thus, you should define initial Work In Progress limits following

the tips provided in this course and, later, enter the Kaizen

Cycle and adjust them as needed.

We are done talking about the first classical mistake when adopting Kanban.

Let’s discuss one more in the following lecture.

See you there!
