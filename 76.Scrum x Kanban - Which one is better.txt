Before going into Scrumban, let’s think about the answer to this

question: which one is better?

Scrum or Kanban?

What do you think?

While Scrum is commonly used to develop products, Kanban is widely applied

to production lines, maintenance management, and other continuous flows.

Given this, which one is the best: Scrum or Kanban?

Asking this is the same thing as asking if it is better to eat

with a fork, knife, or spoon!

It depends on the context and they can be combined!

For example, Scrum.org has a guide explaining how to complement

Scrum with Kanban named “The Kanban Guide for Scrum Teams.”

This guide complements their famous Scrum Guide and is used

as the basis for the Professional Scrum with Kanban certification.

I have attached their Kanban guide as a resource in this lecture.

In case you're interested in getting certified, this course has a bonus

section with instructions, tips, and a practice test for the Professional

Scrum with Kanban assessment.

Now that we have discussed how Scrum and Kanban can be used

together, what is Scrumban?

Scrumban is a hybrid agile development approach that combines

Scrum’s skeleton, with Kanban’s capabilities of optimizing the flow.

In the following lectures, we will see how Scrumban works and

how it uses some of the essential elements of both Kanban and Scrum.
