Read this before taking the real PSK assessment
Are you Ready to take the PSK assessment?



Each person has his/her learning style.



However, as indicators to know if you are ready for taking the assessment you can use the following:



1) Are you able to get 100% on all the assessments and quizzes made available in this course?



2) Are you being able to get 100% on 10 (ten) Scrum with Kanban Open assessments 10 times in a row and finish each assessment in under 6 minutes?



If you answered YES for both questions, it seems like you are in good shape to take the assessment.



If not, use the results as a learning opportunity. Which topics are you missing? After you answer this question, go back to the course's lectures and rewatch them.



If the lectures are not enough, ask a question on the course's Q&A board and I will be more than happy to support you.

Warming up for taking the exam



Our brain is a muscle. Thus, I recommend you warm up by taking, at least, 3 Scrum with Kanban Open assessments before taking the assessment. It is a great way to put you in the correct mindset for passing the PSK assessment on your first attempt!
