As a leader, your main goal is to conduct people to achieve the planned objectives.

For this purpose, you need to learn how to delegate work.

It seems pretty simple.

You take a set of tasks to be done and tell people to do it.

At the end of the process, each one delivers his or her tasks and you succeed.

It sounds pretty easy, right?

Not really!

Poor delegation is one of the main causes for organizations to

not achieve the planned results.

And, who gets the blame?

Poor leaders!

If people on leadership positions, such as project managers, knew how

to delegate tasks, organizations would be way more productive.

Thus, if you want to become an effective leader, you must

learn how to delegate work.

In the next lecture,

you will learn what types of delegation exists.

I'll see you there.
