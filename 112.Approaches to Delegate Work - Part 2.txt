The next type of delegation is Dump & Run.

Here, the leader quickly tells the person what to do.

Doesn't make sure that the person knows how to proceed and disappears.

This type is also called delegation by abdication.

You dump responsibility to other people and run away.

It is very common in scenarios in which the leader had a bad

experience with micromanagement and wants to radically change things.

Or when you are excessively confident in people's abilities.

Or even when you think that there is a common agreement of what needs

to be done when there isn't one.

You don't define deadlines, scope, authority, such as what

decisions can the person make.

You leave everything for the person to figure out without

any guidance or support.

The result is usually having people that are lost.

They don't know what to do.

Worse than that, they don't know if they should look for their leaders to ask

for help because they think that it's their fault for not knowing what to do.

The outcome is obvious.

Lots of rework, waste.

People getting demotivated, and the necessary results are not achieved.

Okay.

Now let's move to the next lecture and talk about the last type of delegation.

I'll see you there.
