Now, let us talk about Daily Meetings, called Daily Scrums, in Scrum.

Kanban does not prescribe Daily Meetings, but conducting them is a good practice

because they allow the team to discuss how to maintain a consistent flow.

In Kanban, the meeting takes place around the Kanban board and focuses on

where flow is lacking and what actions the team can take to get it back.

As with Kanban, Scrumban also has flow-based Daily Meetings.

For this purpose, Scrumban teams usually analyze the CFD and flow

metrics such as lead time, cycle time, work item age, and throughput.

As a consequence, while Scrum Teams usually focus a lot on using burndown

charts to forecast the progress of Sprints, Scrumban teams focus on the CFD.

Why?

Because Scrumban teams don’t worry about meeting a Sprint deadline

but about having a consistent flow.

And by having good lead time, cycle time, and throughput, the burndown is

easily predictable and becomes useless.

Notice that Scrumban’s Daily Meetings are very similar to the

ones conducted by Kanban teams whenever they choose to conduct them.

This similarity is expected since both approaches aim to

maintain a consistent flow.

In the following lecture, let us discuss the Review and Retrospective events.

See you there!
