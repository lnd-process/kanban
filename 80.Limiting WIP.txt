Scrumban seeks

a

continuous flow of value, like Kanban.

Thus, it limits Work in Progress to avoid queues throughout the flow.

It is worth mentioning that some Scrum Teams adopt Kanban practices,

such as limiting Work in Progress, but this is not part of the Scrum

framework and is not mandatory.

Conversely, in Scrumban, we must have Work in Progress limits, especially

for the “Ready” column, since such a limit dictates the team’s

feedback loops, in other words, the virtual iterations’ length.

In the next lecture, let us discuss a Scrum practice adopted by most

Scrumban teams: the Daily Scrum.

See you there!
