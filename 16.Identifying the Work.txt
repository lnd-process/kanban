Now that we are aligned in terms of our example project and that you

already have access to KanbanTool and know how to create a board,

let us simulate identifying the work of our marketing agency.

Identifying the work is the first step in any Kanban initiative.

Each task is recorded on a card and, then, we add them to the Kanban board.

I created a new, and very simple, board from scratch containing

only these columns, which are the default in most tools.

I did this because we are now focusing on identifying the agency’s

tasks, and not mapping the workflow.

Now, let’s create one card for each of the team’s tasks by clicking here.

For each desk, we just need to define its name and we can also

add the people that are assigned to them, which are represented by

their initials on the Kanban board.

Here is the result after I have added a bunch of tasks and assigned some of them.

Notice that, in this example, we have people that are

assigned to multiple tasks.

At this point, let's not worry about multitasking, because it is not the

time yet to address the team's issues, but just to populate the Kanban board.

Further, notice, that, at this point, I added that tasks currently

in progress and the ones note started yet in the TO DO column.

You will understand soon why I did not put tasks already

being done in the DOING column.

Also, notice cards do not have much information, such as delivery date; they

only have a title of and the assignee.

We will add more critical information to the cards later on in this course.

At this point, we have fulfilled our objective, which was to

identify the team's work.

In the following lecture, let's move to the next step: prioritize work.

See you there!
