Now, let us talk about the Review and Retrospective events.

As you already know, in Scrum, they are held at the end of each Sprint.

And in Kanban, they are not prescribed, but it is good practice

to adopt them as feedback loops.

Scrumban teams, in contrast with Scrum Teams, are free to conduct

these events only when needed.

However, the goals of the events are the same as in Scrum.

For example, a Review meeting can happen whenever there are enough

deliverables for the stakeholders to inspect and give feedback.

However, there are cases in which the stakeholders prefer having a

fixed cadency for the Review meetings because of their busy schedules.

It is up to the Scrumban team and stakeholders to decide

what works best for them.

With Retrospective meetings the same thing, the Scrumban

team decides when to hold them.

In contrast with Scrum, Scrumban teams don’t need to conduct a Retrospective

meeting after each Review meeting.

They can decide only to conduct this meeting whenever they

have enough topics to discuss.

However, I must say that, typically, conducting them with a fixed

cadency and short cycles of at most one month is a good practice.

Otherwise, the team risks not looking for ways to improve efficiency and

productivity, and bad behaviors and inefficient practices might perpetuate.

For this reason, skipping Retrospective meetings can be very dangerous.

In summary, compared to Scrum, Scrumban’s Review and Retrospective

meetings have the same purpose, but Scrumban teams have more flexibility

regarding when to conduct them.

In the following lecture, let us discuss accountabilities in Scrumban.

See you there!
