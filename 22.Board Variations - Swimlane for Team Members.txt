Another widespread variation of the Kanban board is the use of swimlanes, not to

identify what is urgent but to highlight who is responsible for the tasks.

For example, suppose we have a system maintenance team

focusing on fixing defects.

In this case, I might want to have something like this that

visually indicates the defects that each team member is working on.

Ideally, each member fixes the defects they are assigned to

independently, being assigned to the card throughout the entire workflow.

Thus, having a swimlane for each team member is an easy way to manage the flow.

The steps to create such swimlanes on KanbanTool are the same ones we discussed

when we created the lane for urgent items.

So, I am not going to go over the steps again here.

Now, stop and think for a little bit.

For this scenario, is it useful to have Buffer Columns?

Pause the video a little bit, answer the question, and come back.

Buffer Columns are not helpful here because the person who will take the

task in the board's next column is the same one who executed the previous step.

Again, ideally, each person takes one card at a time from the

start until the end of the flow.

Thus, we won't have queues in any of the board's columns, except for the first one.

We're done talking about this scenario.

In the following lecture, we will discuss a final variation of using Kanban Boards.

See you there!
