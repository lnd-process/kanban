Now that we have the workflow mapped, on the fourth step, we define Work In

Progress limits, of course, because we do not want the team's flow to have queues.

Setting up the WIP limits is an empirical process; in other words, the team

learns the ideal limits by observing the workflow and making adjustments.

However, we can define the initial limits by considering the number

of people available for each column and the work's complexity.

In the following lecture, we will wrap up this section by discussing

the roadmap's fifth and last step.
