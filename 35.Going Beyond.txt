Going Beyond
In this section, you have learned the metrics used by most Kanban teams.



They are the fundamental metrics for managing your workflow.



However, there are more advanced metrics used by more experienced Kanban teams.



To ensure that you have an initial understanding of them, I attached two articles about the following topics:



Service Level Expectations (Source: Kanbanize)

Aging WIP Chart (Source: Kanbanzone)

ps: notice that the tools discussed in the articles are not currently supported by KanbanTool.



If you have any questions, please, let me know.
