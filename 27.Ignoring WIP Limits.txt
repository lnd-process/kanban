Can we exceed the Work In Progress limits?

The answer is yes, but only in exceptional cases, specifically

when we have urgent items.

As discussed in past lectures, we can modify our traditional

Kanban Board and have a swimlane exclusive for urgent tasks.

Or, instead of having a swimlane, we could just have a

different color for urgent cards.

Independent of how we represent urgent items, in this situation,

we can exceed the Work In Progress limits because we need to do whatever

is necessary to get done with the urgent card as fast as possible.

However, whenever we have urgent items, we disturb the workflow.

Thus, the team must define the policies of what constitutes a task as urgent.

You shouldn't have urgent tasks coming up all the time.

They should be exceptions, but this will only be the case if the teams

defines explicit, well-defined, and agreed-up policies for urgent items.

Thus, answering our original question: yes and no!

We can exceed the Work In Progress limits when we are dealing with urgent items.

However, this situation should be exceptional.

Therefore, in general, you must respect the Work In Progress

limits and use them to guide the team in optimizing the workflow,

making it balanced and predictable.
