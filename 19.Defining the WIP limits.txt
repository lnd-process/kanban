Now that the Kanban board is configured to reflect the team’s

workflow, let us quickly define the Work-In-Progress limits for these columns.

For this purpose, click here on “Settings,” and then

click on “Board Editor.”

Here we have our columns.

Click here to configure the “Write” column.

Over here on “WIP Limit,” let us define it as 1.

“Why 1, Mirko?” I am not using any profound logic here because

we will discuss how to define WIP limits in the next section.

For now, let’s just focus on the steps on how to configure the board on KanbanTool.

Let’s keep moving.

Click on “Save.”

Let’s do the same for “Review,” define the Work-In-Progress limit as 2, and save.

Finally, let’s go to “Publish,” define the Work-In-Progress limit as 2, and save.

Let's close the window, and here we have the Kanban board with

the Work-In-Progress limits.

Now, we have a basic Kanban board set up.

Great job!

However, notice that the Kanban board is very flexible.

To open your mind about the possibilities, I will discuss some examples of

its variations in the subsequent lectures so you can evaluate what can

fit or not in your team's reality.

See you in the following lecture!
