As we saw in this course, the Kanban Board is universal and can be applied

to pretty much any organization.

Setting the Kanban board aside and talking about the Kanban Method,

which is more comprehensive, I have already mentioned that it fits

well with most agile approaches.

A common case is to combine Kanban with the most used agile

approach in the world, Scrum.

The resulting combination is what many people call Scrumban.

Scrumban focuses on agility and continuous value delivery

to the client, and it fits well for various industry sectors.

Given this, this course wouldn’t be complete if it didn’t cover Scrumban.

Since it is possible that you are not familiarized with Scrum yet, before

getting into Scrumban, the following section covers Scrum fundamentals.

If you have already mastered Scrum, you can skip it.

As a quick note, if you decide to skip the Scrum section, I suggest you mark all the

lectures as done to avoid having issues with the course completion certificate.

Ready for the final push and get done with the course?

I will see you in the next lecture!
