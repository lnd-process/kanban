Let's wrap up talking about lessons learned.

And let's start by recapping the context of lessons learned.

When should you use it?

Usually, it will be useful for you whenever you're starting a project.

Whenever working on a project, the first thing you should do

after you have the project scope defined is to look at the lessons

learned from past similar projects.

By doing this, you avoid repeating their mistakes, and

you replicate the good ideas.

What if your organization hasn't adopted lessons learned yet?

Talk to people, try to figure out the past similar projects, and connect

with the people involved in them.

Ask them about the risks and their recommendations.

Further, seize the opportunity to lead the initiative of adopting lessons learned.

Start with your projects, and then encourage and

support others to do as well.

I am sure that your efforts will bring your organization great results and

will make you a more recognized leader.
