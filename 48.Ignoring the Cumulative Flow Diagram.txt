At this point, we have covered three common mistakes that

beginners do when adopting Kanban.

Let’s now discuss the fourth, and last, common mistake: ignoring

the Cumulative Flow Diagram.

Some beginners ignore it because it seems easier to measure performance and manage

flow by looking at the Kanban Board.

For example, we can see that we have a large queue forming on the Review column.

However, the Kanban Board is just a snapshot of the current situation.

The CFD gives you historical data, enabling the team to identify trends

by analyzing the chart and visually seeing how key metrics such as the Lead

Time, Cycle Time, Work in Progress, and Throughput has been changing.

Thus, don’t be lazy in setting up or understanding the CFP just

because you are not used to it.

The CFD is as easy to understand as a pie or bar chart, you might

just need a little bit of time to get more familiarized with it.

Given this, keep your CFD updated, and be sure to monitor it frequently.

And, this is the last common mistake in adopting Kanban that

we will discuss in this course.
