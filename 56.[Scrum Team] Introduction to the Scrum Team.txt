The essence of Scrum is a Scrum Team

as we have previously discussed, the Scrum Team is formed by the Product Owner,

the Scrum Master, and the Developers.

Ideally, you would have one person as the Product Owner, another one for

the Scrum Master, plus the Developers.

Typically, the Scrum Team is composed of 10 or fewer people.

But this is not a rule.

You could have one person playing multiple accountabilities, and it logically

follows that no one needs to be full-time.

The Product Owner is the business person and takes care of the Product Backlog.

The Developers are responsible for transforming the ideas reflected in

the Product Backlog into Increments.

And the Scrum Master is there to make Scrum run smoothly.

Collectively, the Scrum Team is responsible for all product-related

activities, from stakeholder collaboration to research and development.

Further, the entire Scrum Team is accountable for creating a valuable,

usable Increment every Sprint.

The Scrum Team is a cohesive unit of professionals focused on one objective at

a time, the Product Goal, which we will talk more about later in this course.

To achieve the necessary efficiency and flexibility, a Scrum Team is

self-managed and cross-functional, meaning that it has the autonomy to

define who does what, when, and how, and that it has all the skills needed to

accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the Scrum Team.

Now, let's talk about each accountability, starting with the Product Owner, which

is the topic of the next lecture.
