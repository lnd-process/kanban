As Kanban, Scrumban does not prescribe accountabilities for the team.

In contrast, recall that Scrum has three accountabilities: Product

owner, Scrum Master, and Developers.

Sometimes Scrumban teams adopt Scrum’s accountabilities; sometimes, they don’t.

For example, some Scrumban teams have a single Product Owner

responsible for managing the Backlog.

Other Scrumban teams prefer not to have a single person as a

Product Owner and divide such accountability among multiple people.

In conclusion, it is up to the team to define how to better organize themselves.
