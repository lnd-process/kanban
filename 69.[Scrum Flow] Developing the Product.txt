The Development Work is the work performed by the Developers to develop

the Increment during the Sprints.

Now, what exactly do the Developers do during the Sprint?

Since the team is cross-functional, they must be able to do all the work

necessary to deliver Increments.

Depending on your domain, if it's social media, marketing, software development,

hardware development, architecture, engineering, course creation, you

will have different types of tasks.

In the software world, we go from requirement definition to system testing.

So, of course, if you're not from the software world, you don't have

to worry about each of these boxes because you'll have different

boxes depending on your domain.

But the point is that in Scrum, during a Sprint, we want to do all this work.

Usually, the Sprint work is made visible using Scrum Boards.

The Scrum board is a fundamental tool to enable collaboration, communication,

and transparency, important factors to enable self-management.

A good Scrum board is divided into what we call swim lanes.

Swim lanes separate information from different Product Backlog items.

For example, this swimlane that I have highlighted only has the work related

to the first Product Backlog item.

The first column holds the Product Backlog items, and the remaining

ones represented team's workflow.

The most simple version of the board divides work into three steps: To

Do, holding the tasks not started;

WIP, which stands for work in progress and holds the tasks started, but not finished,

and Done, for the work that is done.

You could have more steps here, but this decision is up to the Developers.

You could represent the Scrum board physically, on your

wall, or use a software tool.

And this is all you need to know about the Development Work.

Great.

Let's move to the next Scrum event: The Daily Scrum, the

topic of the next lecture.
