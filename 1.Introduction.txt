Hello!

My name is Mirko Perkusich, a specialist in Agile, Project Management,

and achieving High Productivity.

Welcome to this great experience that we will live here together, not

only going deep and specializing in the Kanban Method, but also learning

and practicing the most used agile and lean approaches worldwide.

The truth is that, right now, we are ongoing a revolution

regarding the way companies plan, execute, and manage their work.

As a result, I would not be able to tell you that this is a complete Kanban course

without discussing Scrum, Scrumban, the difference between these approaches,

advantages, disadvantages, and when you should use each of them.

It does not matter your area of expertise; our strategy here in this course is

to experience practical and real-world examples from diverse market sectors.

We will do that by using mature and well-known tools, which means that, by the

end of this course, you'll be capable of taking Kanban and other approaches that

you will learn and apply them to your company or the company in which you work for,

including ready-to-use templates!

This course will not fill you with theory and yada yada.

No, I want to bring the transformation to your life, to give you much more

value than you're expecting to receive, and together upgrade your professional

path by teaching you valuable knowledge.

So, lock yourself in your room or at your office, turn off your phone, put your

headphones on, and let us dive into this course so that we can together transform

the knowledge that you will acquire here into growing opportunities for you.
